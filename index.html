        <h1>Here's everything you ever wanted to know about me!</h1>
        <p>I used to work at a bank and was looking for ideas before deciding to go back to school to use my new GI Bill Benefits. I could not stand the system we used to do our work. I was constantly coming up with new ideas that would make the system better and more user friendly and make our work more efficient. I just had no idea how to do, much less how to go about doing any such things. So, I enrolled in school in a Computer Information Systems. Unfortunately, it didn't do anything to help me get a job. In fact, it probably hindered me.</p>
        <p>I have been trying to get into the IT field, preferably programming such as web design (which is my major) or software development, for a few years now. I started while I was in school and have been trying ever since until the wonderful Apprenti program came along. Within a few months I was interviewing with large companies such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Amazon</li>
            <li>Microsoft</li>
          </ul>
        Fast forward a few months, here I sit at CodeFellows learning/brushing up on my previously learned skills from my undergrad (DeVry University) and Master's programs (Keller Graduate School of Management). I obtained my:
          <ol>
            <li>Bahelor's in Computer Information Systems</li>
            <li>Master's in Information Systems Management</li>
          </ol>
        I worked for a while as a web development intern during my undergrad studies but it wasn't going to turn into a paying job so I quit after six months. My goal is to successfully finish my current education so I can start the year-long on-th-job training contract I have with Microsoft. After that I hope to get hired on permanently with Microsoft, although if that doesn't work I know that between CodeFellows and Microsoft I will have learned some valuable life and job skills that should make me successful anywhere I go.
